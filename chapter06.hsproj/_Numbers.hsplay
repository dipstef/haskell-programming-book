{- Exercise: 
   
   Tuple Experiment Look at the types given for quotRem and divMod. What do you think those functions do? Test your hy- potheses by playing with them in the REPL. Weâ€™ve given you a sample to start with below  -}
   
let ones x = snd (divMod x 10)

divMod 31 10
quotRem 10 3

divMod 20 (-3)
quotRem 20 (-3)

divMod (-21) 10
quotRem (-22) 10
